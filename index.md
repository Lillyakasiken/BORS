> ## Prerequisites
> This course is for Students of all disciplines which are working at least in part empirically and who have had an introduction to empirical research. Intermediate IT skills are a prerequisite: students need to know the file tree structure on their device (where is a file?) and need to be able to install packages and programs. 
>
>
> Participants need to have basic R skills, that is they need to know 
> - how to assign values to an object, 
> - how to manipulate and extract the entries of an object, 
> - how to do simple calculations on objects such as percentages, 
> - how to use functions such as t.test and 
> - how to create simple plots. 
>
>
>Participants who do not have these skills can work through the first three lessons of "R for Social Scientists" at [https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/]().
