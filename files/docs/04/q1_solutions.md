___

### 3. Transparency 

a. Is a protocol, study plan, or registration of the study at hand mentioned?

c. No code sharing is mentioned.  
d. There is an ethics statement which mentions discussions with John Hopkins determining that the work is not human subject research.  
e. The authors declare not CoI.


*Let’s dig deeper*
