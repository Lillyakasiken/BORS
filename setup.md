title: Setup

We need both, R and Rstudio. They are separate downloads and installations. R is the underlying statistical computing environment. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R user-friendly. You need to install R before you install RStudio. Once both are installed RStudio will run R in the background. You do not need to run it separately.

- you install R from [https://cran.r-project.org/](), please make sure that you have at least version 4.0
- you install Rstudio from [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](), please make sure that you have a t least version 1.2
